## Introduction

SecureShareSystem enables secure image sharing with the following goals:
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption protects images during transmission and storage.
- **Usability**: An intuitive interface ensures seamless use on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Scalability**: The system supports multiple users and efficient image uploads.

## Key Features

### User Authentication
- **Secure Login/Registration**: Passwords are hashed with Argon2 for robust security.
- **Token Management**: JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with expiration times authenticate sessions.

### Image Upload and Encryption
- **Upload**: Supports JPEG/PNG files with a 10MB size limit.
- **Encryption**: Client-side AES-256 encryption with RSA key management ensures privacy.

### Image Sharing
- **Unique Links/IDs**: Shareable links with optional expiration enhance security.
- **Access Control**: Only recipients with the private key can decrypt and view images.

### Image Viewing
- **Decryption**: Client-side decryption keeps unencrypted data off the server.
- **Viewer**: A secure, browser-based interface displays images without local storage.

### Integrity Check
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 hashes verify image integrity after decryption.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: `actix-web` (Rust) for performance and security.
- **Database**: `sqlx` (async SQL toolkit) for reliable data management.
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem, with potential AWS S3 integration.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: ReactJS for a dynamic, component-based UI.
- **UI Components**: Custom or React Bootstrap for a polished design.
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useContext`).
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API for secure operations.
- **Communication**: HTTPS with TLS for secure backend interaction.

### Development Tools
- **Build Tools**: `cargo` (Rust), `npm` (JavaScript).
- **Version Control**: Git.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization.

## Setup and Installation

   cd SecureShareSystem
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Install Rust and Cargo.
   - In the backend directory, run:
     ```bash
     cargo build
     cargo run
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Install Node.js and npm.
   - In the frontend directory, run:

     npm start
     ```

4. **Database**:
   - Configure a local SQL database and update backend connection settings.

## Usage

1. **Register** an account.
2. **Upload** an image (encrypted client-side).
3. **Share** the generated unique link with the recipient.
4. **View** the image by decrypting it with the recipientâ€™s private key.
